<p>A set of constraints are separable when there are subsets of the design variables that don’t affect
any of the responses. In other words, there is some subset of columns of the
<strong>total-derivative Jacobian</strong> where none of those columns have nonzero values in any of the same rows.
This kind of sparsity structure in the total-derivative Jacobian allows OpenMDAO to solve for multiple
total derivatives simultaneously, which can dramatically reduce the cost of computing total derivatives.
Remember that OpenMDAO solves the <a class="reference internal" href="total_derivs_theory.html#theory-total-derivatives"><span class="std std-ref">unified derivative equations</span></a> to
compute total derivatives.</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\left[\frac{\partial \mathcal{R}}{\partial U}\right] \left[\frac{du}{dr}\right] = \left[ I \right] = \left[\frac{\partial \mathcal{R}}{\partial U}\right]^T \left[\frac{du}{dr}\right]^T .\]</div>
<p>When separable constraints are present, multiple right hand sides from <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\left[ I \right]\)</span> can
be combined into a single right-hand-side vector, and then total derivatives for multiple variables
can be computed with a single linear solve. Normally, summing multiple right-hand-side vectors would
result in the solution vector holding linear combinations of multiple derivatives:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}\begin{gather}
\frac{du_0}{dr_0} + \frac{du_0}{dr_2} + \cdots + \frac{du_0}{dr_n}\\
\vdots \\
\frac{du_m}{dr_0} + \frac{du_m}{dr_2} + \cdots + \frac{du_m}{dr_n}\\
\end{gather}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>However, because the problem is separable, we know that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{dy_i}{dx_j}=0\)</span> for all <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i \ne j\)</span> for seperable variables.
Therefore, it is safe to do all the linear solves at the same time, and we can get a significant
computational savings with no additional complexity of memory costs.</p>

<div class="section" id="a-simple-example">
<h2>A Simple Example<a class="headerlink" href="#a-simple-example" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Consider a notional optimization problem with 5 design variables (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a, b, c, d, e\)</span>), one objective
(<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f\)</span>), and three constraints (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(g_c, g_d, g_e\)</span>). Normally with 5 design variables and 4
responses — 3 constraints + 1 objective — you would choose to use reverse mode since that would
yield fewer linear solves. However, if the problem had the following partial derivative Jacobian
structure, then it would be separable in forward mode, and we’ll show that because of that, forward
mode is the preferred method.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../../_images/simultaneous_jac.png"><img alt="Jacobian structure for a notional separable problem." src="../../_images/simultaneous_jac.png" style="width: 75%;" /></a>
</div>
<p>The two dense columns corresponding to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a, b\)</span> mean that all of the outputs depend on these
variables and they must each get their own linear solves in forward mode.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../../_images/simultaneous_dense.png"><img alt="Two linear solves needed for the two non-separable variables" src="../../_images/simultaneous_dense.png" style="width: 75%;" /></a>
</div>
<p>Normally, each of the remaining variables, (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c, d, e\)</span>), would also need their own linear solves, as shown below.
In the solution and right-hand-side vectors, the zero values are denoted by the lighter-colored blocks.
The nonzero values are denoted by the darker-colored blocks.
Notice how the three solution vectors have no overlapping nonzero values.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../../_images/simultaneous_sparse_separate.png"><img alt="Three separate linear solves for the separable variables." src="../../_images/simultaneous_sparse_separate.png" style="width: 75%;" /></a>
</div>
<p>Those three solution vectors are non-overlapping because the three associated variables are separable.
The forward-separable structure shows up clearly in the partial-derivative Jacobian, because it has
been ordered to expose a block-diagonal structure.
This allows us to collapse all three linear solves into a single simultaneous one:</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../../_images/simultaneous_sparse_combined.png"><img alt="Three separate linear solves for the separable variables." src="../../_images/simultaneous_sparse_combined.png" style="width: 75%;" /></a>
</div>
<p>Using forward simultaneous derivatives reduces the required number of solves from 5 to 3
(2 for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a, b\)</span> and 1 for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c, d, e\)</span>).
Hence, it would be faster to solve for total derivatives using forward mode with simultaneous
derivatives than reverse mode.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="determining-if-your-problem-is-separable">
<h2>Determining if Your Problem is Separable<a class="headerlink" href="#determining-if-your-problem-is-separable" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The simple example above was contrived to make it relatively obvious that the problem was separable.
For realistic problems, even if you know that the problem should be separable, computing the actual
input/output sets can be challenging. You can think of the total derivative Jacobian as a graph with
nodes representing each variable and non-zero entries representing edges connecting the nodes.
Then the task of finding the separable variables can be performed using a graph-coloring algorithm.
In that case, a set of separable variables are said to have the same color.
The simple example problem would then have three colors; one each for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(b\)</span> and
one more for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c,d,e\)</span>.</p>
<p>For any arbitrary problem, once you know the total-derivative Jacobian, then, in theory, you could color it.
Since OpenMDAO can compute the total-derivative Jacobian, it would seem to be simply a matter of
applying a coloring algorithm to it. However, there is a potential pitfall that needs to be accounted for.
For any arbitrary point in the design space, some total derivatives could turn out to be zero, despite
the fact that they are nonzero at other locations. An incidental zero would mean a missing edge in
the graph, and could potentially deliver an incorrect coloring. The challenge is to figure out the
non-zero entries in the total derivative Jacobian in a more robust way.</p>
<p>OpenMDAO knows the partial-derivative sparsity of a model because the
<a class="reference internal" href="../../features/core_features/working_with_derivatives/sparse_partials.html#feature-sparse-partials"><span class="std std-ref">nonzero partials are specified</span></a> by each component in its setup method.
So we need to compute the sparsity pattern of the total Jacobian, given the sparsity pattern of the
partial Jacobian, in a way that reduces the chance of getting incidental zero values.</p>
<p>We can minimize the chance of having incidental zeros in the inverse by setting random numbers into the nonzero entries of the partial-derivative matrix,
then computing the resulting total-derivative Jacobian using the randomized values. The derivatives computed in this way will not be physically meaningful,
but the chance of having any incidental zero values is now very small. The likelihood of incidental zeros can be further reduced by
computing the total-derivative Jacobian multiple times with different, random left-hand sides, and summing the absolute values of the
resulting total-derivative Jacobians together.</p>
<p>Hence the cost of the coloring algorithm increases by the cost of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\)</span> computations of the full total-derivative Jacobian.
The larger you choose to make <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\)</span>, the more reliable your coloring will be.
If the model is intended to be used in an optimization context, then it is fair to assume that the total-derivative Jacobian is inexpensive enough to compute many times,
and using a few additional computations to compute a coloring will not significantly impact the overall compute cost.</p>

<h2>Choosing Forward or Reverse Mode for Separable Problems<a class="headerlink" href="#choosing-forward-or-reverse-mode-for-separable-problems" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If a problem has a section of design variables and constraints that are separable,
then it is possible to leverage that quality in either forward or reverse mode.
Which mode you choose depends on which direction gives you fewer total linear solves.
In the example above, we show how separability changes the faster method from reverse to forward, but in general it does not have to cause that effect.</p>
<p>Normally you would count the number of design variables and responses and choose the mode corresponding to whichever one is smaller.
For separable problems, you count the number of colors you have in each direction and choose which ever one is smaller.
Sometimes the answer is different than you would get by counting design variables and constraints, but sometimes its not.
The result is problem-dependent.</p>
